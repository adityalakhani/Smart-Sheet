[22:19:54] CONVERSATION - INTERVIEWERAGENT:
Welcome to your adaptive Excel skills assessment, Aditya Lakhani! This evaluation will adjust to your responses and focus on areas that need the most attention.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[22:19:54] CONVERSATION - INTERVIEWERAGENT:
Okay, let me describe a data situation you might encounter.

Your company has merged two customer databases. You now have a consolidated list of customer names and email addresses, but you've noticed several inconsistencies. Some names have leading or trailing spaces, some email addresses are missing, and some are duplicated with slight variations in capitalization.

How would you approach cleaning this data using Excel? Please walk me through your thinking, the steps you'd take, and the Excel functions you would use to address these issues. Take your time to think through the approach. We'll focus on the methodology, so don't worry about perfect syntax.

METADATA: {

  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "adaptive_reasoning": "This question assesses fundamental data cleaning skills, which are crucial for any data analyst role. It requires the candidate to identify common data quality issues and apply relevant Excel functions to resolve them."

[22:20:08] CONVERSATION - INTERVIEWEE:
Okay, I understand the problem. We have a merged customer database with inconsistencies in names and email addresses, and the goal is to clean it up using Excel. Here's my approach:

**1. Initial Assessment and Data Exploration:**

*   **Examine the Dataset:** The first thing I'd do is visually inspect the dataset (let's assume it's in a worksheet named "CustomerData"). I'd scroll through the "Name" and "Email Address" columns to get a sense of the types of inconsistencies present. This helps me prioritize which cleaning steps to take first.
*   **Basic Summary Statistics:** I might use formulas like `COUNTA(CustomerData!A:A)` (for total number of names) and `COUNTBLANK(CustomerData!B:B)` (for number of missing email addresses) to get a quick overview of the data quality issues. This gives me a quantitative understanding of the problem.

**2. Addressing Leading/Trailing Spaces in Names:**

*   **`TRIM` Function:** The most straightforward solution for removing leading and trailing spaces is the `TRIM` function. I'd create a new column (e.g., "Cleaned Name") and use the formula `=TRIM(CustomerData!A2)` in cell C2. Then, I'd drag this formula down to apply it to all names in the dataset. `TRIM` removes all spaces from a text string except for single spaces between words.
*   **Why `TRIM`:** It's efficient and specifically designed for this purpose. Alternatives like `SUBSTITUTE` would be less efficient.

**3. Handling Missing Email Addresses:**

*   **Identifying Missing Values:** As noted above, I'd use `COUNTBLANK` initially. I would also use conditional formatting to visually highlight blank cells in the "Email Address" column (e.g., format cells where `CustomerData!B2=""` to have a specific background color). This allows me to quickly identify records with missing email addresses.
*   **Data Imputation (if possible and appropriate):** Depending on the business context, there might be ways to impute missing email addresses. For example:
    *   If the same customer appears multiple times with different capitalization in names, one entry may have an email address while the others don't. I could use `VLOOKUP` or `INDEX/MATCH` in conjunction with an `IF` statement to populate the missing email if one exists elsewhere in the dataset for a "similar" name (cleaned using `TRIM` and `LOWER`, see below).
    *   If there's a separate customer database or CRM system, I could potentially look up missing email addresses using the customer's name and other available information.
*   **Flagging and Filtering:** If imputation isn't possible or appropriate, I'd add a column (e.g., "Email Missing Flag") with the formula `=IF(ISBLANK(CustomerData!B2), "Yes", "No")`. This allows me to easily filter the data to isolate records with missing email addresses for further review or exclusion from certain analyses.

**4. Removing Duplicate Entries (Case-Insensitive):**

*   **Standardizing Names and Email Addresses:** Before identifying duplicates, I need to standardize the capitalization. I'd create new columns for "Lowercase Name" and "Lowercase Email" using the `LOWER` function: `=LOWER(CustomerData!C2)` (using the "Cleaned Name" column) and `=LOWER(CustomerData!B2)`. This ensures that "John Doe" and "john doe" are treated as the same.
*   **Creating a Concatenated Key:** To easily identify duplicates, I'd create a concatenated key combining the standardized name and email address. For example, in a "Concatenated Key" column, I'd use the formula `=CustomerData!D2&"_"&CustomerData!E2` (where D is "Lowercase Name" and E is "Lowercase Email"). The underscore helps avoid accidental matches if a name and email run together.
*   **Identifying Duplicates with `COUNTIF`:** I'd use the `COUNTIF` function to count the occurrences of each concatenated key. In a "Duplicate Count" column, I'd use the formula `=COUNTIF(CustomerData!F:F, CustomerData!F2)`. This will tell me how many times each unique key appears in the dataset.
*   **Filtering and Removing Duplicates:** I'd filter the data to show only rows where the "Duplicate Count" is greater than 1. This isolates the duplicate entries. From there, I could either manually review and delete the duplicates, or use Excel's "Remove Duplicates" feature (Data -> Remove Duplicates) *after making a backup of the original data*. When using "Remove Duplicates," I would select only the "Concatenated Key" column to ensure that only truly identical entries are removed.

**5. Error Handling and Validation:**

*   **Data Validation:** I'd consider adding data validation rules to the "Email Address" column to prevent future errors. This could include:
    *   **Format Check:** Using a custom formula like `=ISNUMBER(SEARCH("@",CustomerData!B2))` to ensure that the email address contains an "@" symbol.
    *   **Length Restriction:** Limiting the maximum length of the email address to prevent excessively long entries.
*   **`IFERROR` Function:** If I were performing more complex calculations or lookups on the cleaned data, I'd use the `IFERROR` function to handle potential errors gracefully. For example, `=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(..., ...), "Error")` would display "Error" if the `VLOOKUP` function returns an error.
*   **Auditing:** I'd document all the steps I took to clean the data and the formulas I used. This is important for reproducibility and transparency.

**6. Performance Considerations:**

*   For very large datasets (hundreds of thousands of rows or more), the `COUNTIF` function for duplicate detection can be slow. In such cases, I might consider using Power Query (Get & Transform Data) which is more efficient for large-scale data manipulation or even exporting the data to a database like MySQL and using SQL queries for data cleaning.

**7. Business Context and Communication:**

*   Before making any significant changes to the data, I'd consult with stakeholders to understand the business rules and requirements. For example, are there specific criteria for determining which duplicate entry to keep? Are there preferred formats for names and email addresses?
*   After cleaning the data, I'd communicate the changes I made and the rationale behind them to the relevant stakeholders.

**In summary, my approach involves a combination of Excel functions (TRIM, LOWER, COUNTIF, IF, ISBLANK, IFERROR), data validation, and a clear understanding of the business context. I'd prioritize data quality, reproducibility, and communication throughout the process.**
